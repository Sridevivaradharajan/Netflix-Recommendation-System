# Personalized Netflix Recommendations using Content-Based Filtering
This project explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, focusing on data analysis, clustering, and developing a content-based recommendation system.

## Features 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A comprehensive EDA is performed using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis (UBM) to understand data distribution, relationships between features, and to inform the modeling approach.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Textual data from show descriptions and other features are processed to create meaningful representations for the recommendation system.

Clustering: This project applies multiple clustering algorithms K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN to group similar movies and TV shows, allowing for a comparison of different clustering methods.

Content-Based Recommendations: An adapted recommendation engine suggests new titles to users based on the content of shows they have previously enjoyed.
